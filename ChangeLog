- enhancement: report percent done, when input size is known (is a file)
- enhancement: watchdog raises SIGKILL if SIGINT had no effect
- change: start watchdog when parsing option -W or after parsing all
          options when activated via defaults file
  => Originally the watchdog was started after output to make sure
     output initialization doesn't unintentionally trigger the watchdog
     due to delays with a manual setup on the receiving side in a
     network situation.
  => This behavior limits potential benefits when mbuffer is used in an 
     automated environment where output initialization might fail and
     the watchdog would be of use.
  => To avoid triggering the watchdog during network initialization, put
     the watchdog option -W after network options -O and -I.

20060324:
- added option -c to enable synchronous data integrity I/O:
  This was enabled by default until now, but may cause a decrease in
  performance as it requires a higher number of I/O ops. On systems
  without full synchronous data integrity support, no difference will
  be observable concerning performance. Systems that support it, will
  gain increased performace without -c, but error reporting will be 
  more precise with -c.
